# Use case specific Model of Production Data based on Meta-model of Production Data
This is the repository of the editable template of _Meta-model of Production Data (MMPD)_ and derived _Models of Production Data (MPD)_ according to requirements of specific use case. The concept of _MMPD_ is developed in the conference paper _Towards a flexible process-independent meta-model for production data_ [1] for _14th CIRP Conference on Intelligent Computation in Manufacturing Engineering_ by Cramer et al. The derived _MPDs_ are introduced in the conference paper _Towards predictive quality in production by applying a flexible process-independent meta-model_ [2] for _54th CIRP Conference on Manufacturing Systems_ by Liang et al.

## Usage
The template of the _MMPD_ describes the involved class and their relation. The definition of each class can be found in the paper by Liang et al. 

This template can be edited by Microsoft Visio. You can derive your own _MPD_ based on the _MMPD_ template according to the use case. The generated _MPD_ ensures the integration of heterogeneous data sources and serves as the foundation for further _Predictive Quality_ applications.

The paper by Liang et al. also introduces three use cases and their corresponding _MPDs_. The _MPDs_ is also editable by Microsoft Visio. You are welcomed to adjust them for your own production processes, which are similar as described in the paper.
